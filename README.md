Archerank2
==========

For the evaluation of archery tournaments.

motivation
----------

I got a sqlite file from Archerank, but I did not receive the program itself.
Would like to create a program with which a better database,
and should create winners deeds as a pdf.

But data from Archerank2 should not use for Archerank,
because I have no software to test it and I would like it not.
Archerank2 should be a software with new ideas, modern design and free use (GPL). 
Help is very welcome.
